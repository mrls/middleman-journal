Middleman Journal Engine Extension

The `middleman-blog` extension does a bit too much for what I want from a
journal. At the same time it does a bit too little about how I'd like to
interact with my journal from the CLI. With this extension I try to solve those
problems in a simple way.


_Note: middleman-journal is still under early development. This means you should
not rely on the commands and functions provided atm, but it also means you can
help drive the project ;)_

## Installation

Add it to your `Gemfile`

```
gem 'middleman-journal'
```

## CLI commands

Create a new journal entry for today:

```
middleman entry
```
